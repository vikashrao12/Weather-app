#  Weather Forecast Application

##  Introduction
This Weather Forecast Application is a simple web-based project developed using **HTML, Tailwind CSS, and JavaScript**.  
The main goal of this project is to fetch real-time weather data from an external API and display it in a clean and user-friendly interface.

Users can search weather details by entering a **city name** or by using their **current location**.  
The application also saves recently searched cities to improve user experience.

This project is created as part of a **web development assignment** to understand API integration, responsive UI design, and JavaScript DOM manipulation.

- Learn how to integrate a third-party API in JavaScript
- Practice DOM manipulation and event handling
- Implement location-based services using the browser’s Geolocation API
